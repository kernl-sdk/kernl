# Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout kernl.

## Agent

A configured LLM with instructions, tools, and memory settings. Agents are stateless — they define behavior but don't hold conversation state.

## Thread

A single execution of an agent. Contains message history, tool calls, and state. Threads are the unit of persistence and can be resumed.

## Memory

Knowledge that persists beyond individual threads. Can be created, searched, and updated by agents or manually.

## Toolkit

A collection of related tools that can be attached to an agent. Tools are functions the LLM can call to take actions.

## Namespace

A logical partition for isolating threads and memories. Useful for multi-tenant applications.

## Context

Runtime data passed into an agent's execution — user info, session state, or any data your agent needs access to.
