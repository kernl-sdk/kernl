Key terms and concepts used throughout kernl.

1.1 :: **Agent**. A language model (LLM) which is configured with instructions, model settings, and tools. Agents are stateless — they define behavior but don't hold conversation state.

1.2 :: **Thread**. A stateful execution of an agent with a clear lifecycle, which consists of a sequence of events.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) **State**. Temporary data relevant only during the current session.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) **Event**. The content of the conversation, as well as actions taken by agents such as tool calls.

1.3 :: **Memory**. Knowledge that persists beyond individual threads. Can be created, searched, and updated by agents or manually.

1.4 :: **Context**. Runtime data passed into an agent's execution — user info, session state, or any data your agent needs access to. It is a propagation mechanism which carries execution-scoped values across API boundaries.

1.5 :: **Toolkit**. A collection of related tools that can be attached to an agent (e.g. `gmail :: {list, send, ...}`).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) **Tool**. A function the LLM can call to take actions or retrieve information.

1.6 :: **Namespace**. A logical partition for isolating threads and memories. Useful for multi-tenant applications.
