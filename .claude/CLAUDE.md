# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Development Guidelines

- We use **pnpm** as our package manager
- At the beginning of any conversation, familiarize yourself with the repo structure
- Prefer method names with linux style, lowercase short words
- Never promote yourself in commits (no "Generated with Claude" messages)
- If we refactor something and are no longer using an old file, clean up after yourself

`pnpm build` is the build command - not `pnpm build:_` or anything else.
