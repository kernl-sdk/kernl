# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Tasks

At the start of each conversation, read `.tasks/TODO.md` for today's date to see what we're working on. Always keep this file updated as we complete tasks or start new ones. This keeps us in sync across sessions.

## Development Guidelines

- We use **pnpm** as our package manager
- At the beginning of any conversation, familiarize yourself with the repo structure
- Prefer method names with linux style, lowercase short words
- Never promote yourself in commits (no "Generated with Claude" messages)
- If we refactor something and are no longer using an old file, clean up after yourself

`pnpm build` is the build command - not `pnpm build:_` or anything else.
