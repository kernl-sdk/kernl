# kernl :: microprojects

A set of small, production-ready microprojects that show how to use the runtime with real workflows. Each one is built around simple connectors (GitHub, Linear, etc.) and demonstrates clean, composable agent patterns.

A planning and coordination assistant for small teams.

- Jarvis pulls from Linear and GitHub to surface blockers, unreviewed PRs, priorities, and a snapshot of what’s shipping next.
- Perfect example of structured-data querying + synthesis.
