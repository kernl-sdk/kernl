# kernl - microprojects

A set of small, production-ready microprojects that show how to use the runtime with real workflows. Each one is built around simple connectors (Mintlify, GitHub, Linear, Browser) and demonstrates clean, composable agent patterns.

## 1. Jarvis — Chief of Staff

A planning and coordination assistant for small teams.

- Jarvis pulls from Linear and GitHub to surface blockers, unreviewed PRs, priorities, and a snapshot of what’s shipping next.
- Perfect example of structured-data querying + synthesis.

## 2. Atlas — Documentation assistant

A drop-in docs Q&A agent.

- Codex integrates with Mintlify (or any static docs) to answer product and API questions with grounded citations.
- Showcases retrieval, ranking, and answer generation with zero indexing pipeline.
