We just published a new guide: [Charger — A Coding Agent](/docs/guides/coding-agent).

It walks through building a complete coding agent that can read, write, and execute code in a sandboxed environment using [Daytona](https://daytona.io). The whole thing takes about 10 minutes.

## What you'll build

- An agent with file system, shell, and git tools running in isolated Daytona sandboxes
- Web search via MCP (using Parallel AI)
- A custom todo toolkit for task tracking
- A streaming API server with Hono
- A chat UI using the Vercel AI SDK

## Key patterns

The guide covers some patterns we think are important:

**Lazy sandbox provisioning** — sandboxes are created on first tool use, not upfront. The sandbox ID is stored in thread context, so it survives across HTTP requests.

**Credentials through context** — git tokens flow through context server-side, never touching the LLM. The model just calls `git_clone(url, path)` and the tool injects auth. No accidental leakage in responses or logs.

**Type-safe context** — toolkit contexts are intersected (`SandboxContext & TodoContext`), so TypeScript ensures your tools have access to the state they need.

## Try it

```bash
pnpm create kernl@latest charger
cd charger
npm install -g @kernl-sdk/cli
kernl add toolkit daytona
kernl add toolkit parallel
```

Then follow the [full guide](/docs/guides/coding-agent) or check out the [complete example](https://github.com/kernl-sdk/kernl/tree/master/microprojects/charger).
