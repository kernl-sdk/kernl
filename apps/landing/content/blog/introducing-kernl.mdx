We're excited to introduce kernl, a TypeScript framework for building AI agents that remember, reason, and act.

## Why we built this

Most agent frameworks give you a chat loop and call it a day. You're left stitching together conversation persistence, memory that outlives a single session, tool execution, and multi-turn reasoning. kernl treats these as first-class concerns, not afterthoughts.

## What makes kernl different

- **Memory is not optional.** Memory is the bottleneck to personalization and utility. Agents that remember context over time are fundamentally more useful. kernl makes this easy.
- **Provider agnostic.** No vendor lock-in. Swap models per-agent or per-request. Use Claude for reasoning, GPT for generation, whatever fits your use case.
- **TypeScript-native.** Full type safety. Your IDE knows what's happening. No magic strings, no runtime surprises.

## Philosophy

- Open must win.
- Composition over inheritance.
- Customizable where you need it.
- Full control of the execution environment. We know you want to run your tools + agents in *your* env.


## Basic usage

Agents run on threads (persistent conversation state) and build memories (knowledge that spans threads). The Kernl runtime orchestrates execution and storage.

```ts
import { Kernl, Agent } from "kernl";
import { postgres } from "@kernl-sdk/pg";
import { anthropic } from "@kernl-sdk/ai/anthropic";

const kernl = new Kernl({
  storage: {
    db: postgres({ connstr: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
  }
});

const agent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "Assistant",
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  memory: { enabled: true },
});

kernl.register(agent);

const result = await agent.run("Remember that I prefer dark mode.", {
  threadId: "thread_123",
});
```

## Toolkits

Agents become useful when they can act. kernl has first-class support for toolkits—collections of tools that agents can use to accomplish tasks.

```ts
import { tool, Toolkit } from "kernl";
import { z } from "zod";

const search = tool({
  id: "search",
  description: "Search the web",
  parameters: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
  execute: async (ctx, { query }) => {
    // your implementation
  },
});

export const web = new Toolkit({
  id: "web",
  description: "Web search tools",
  tools: [search],
});
```

We also support MCP (Model Context Protocol) out of the box, so you can connect to any MCP server without writing integration code.

## Get started

```bash
npm install kernl
```

Read the [documentation](https://docs.kernl.sh) to learn more, or browse the [marketplace](/marketplace) for pre-built toolkits.
