excerpt: Browse and install pre-built toolkits with a single command.
---

The toolkit marketplace is now live. Browse available toolkits at [kernl.sh/marketplace](/marketplace) and add them to your project:

```bash
kernl add toolkit github
```

This downloads the toolkit source to your `toolkits/` directory and installs any required dependencies.

```ts
import { github } from "@/toolkits/github";

const agent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  toolkits: [github],
});
```

We're launching with toolkits for GitHub, Linear, Slack, Notion, and Postgres. More coming soon.
