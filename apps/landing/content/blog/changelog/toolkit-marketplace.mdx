excerpt: Browse and install pre-built toolkits with a single command.

The toolkit marketplace is now live. Browse available toolkits at [kernl.sh/marketplace](/marketplace) and add them to your project:

```bash
kernl add toolkit github
```

## The philosophy

From the very beginning, the goal was to make toolkits customizable.

The idea is to give you solid defaults — well-structured tools, clear descriptions, sensible implementations — and then let you take it from there. Tweak the execution logic. Add new tools. Change how things work for your particular context. Build your own version.

When you add a toolkit, the source code is copied directly into your project — just like [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com). No package dependency, just files in your `toolkits/` directory that you fully control.

```
toolkits/
└── github/
    ├── index.ts      ← yours to modify
    ├── create-issue.ts
    ├── list-repos.ts
    └── ...
```

Maybe you want the `create-issue` tool to auto-assign based on your team's rotation. Maybe you want to add custom labels, or filter repos by org. The code is right there — make it yours.

## How it works

This downloads the toolkit source to your `toolkits/` directory and installs any required dependencies.

```ts
import { github } from "@/toolkits/github";

const agent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  toolkits: [github],
});
```

We're launching with toolkits for GitHub, Linear, Slack, Notion, and Postgres. More coming soon.
