# kernl

> kernl is a TypeScript framework for building AI agents that remember, reason, and act. It provides first-class support for persistent memory, thread-based execution, and tool integration. Provider agnostic. Open source.

## Overview

- [Introduction](https://docs.kernl.sh/): Core principles—async-first, memory as a first-class citizen, provider agnostic, governance built-in.
- [Architecture](https://docs.kernl.sh/architecture): System design covering Kernl runtime, Agents, Threads, Toolkits, Memory, and Storage.
- [Getting Started](https://docs.kernl.sh/getting-started): Installation via CLI or npm, project setup, and basic configuration.
- [Glossary](https://docs.kernl.sh/glossary): Terminology and definitions.

## Concepts

- [Agents](https://docs.kernl.sh/concepts/agents): Creating agents with instructions, models, tools, and memory. Blocking and streaming execution.
- [Context](https://docs.kernl.sh/concepts/context): Passing runtime data (user info, session state, feature flags) into agent execution. Type-safe context.
- [Memory](https://docs.kernl.sh/concepts/memory): Memory hierarchy (working, short-term, long-term). Manual and autonomous memory operations.
- [Threads](https://docs.kernl.sh/concepts/threads): Execution state management. Creating, resuming, and persisting threads. Namespaces for multi-tenancy.
- [Toolkits](https://docs.kernl.sh/concepts/toolkits): Tool collections. Standard Toolkit for TypeScript functions, MCPToolkit for MCP server integration.
- [Realtime / Voice](https://docs.kernl.sh/concepts/realtime): Voice-enabled agents with real-time audio streaming. Browser (direct connection) and Node.js (server-side) patterns.
