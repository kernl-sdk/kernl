<OverviewHero description="A Typescript framework for building AI agents that remember, reason, and act." />

## Introduction

Most agent frameworks give you a chat loop and call it a day. You're left stitching together:

- Conversation persistence
- Memory that outlives a single session
- Tool execution
- Voice / realtime

kernl treats these as first-class concerns, not afterthoughts. It's also the only framework with provider-agnostic realtime support — build voice agents that work across OpenAI, Google, and others without rewriting your code.

## Basic usage

Agents run on **threads** (persistent conversation state) and build **memories** (knowledge that spans threads). The **Kernl** runtime orchestrates execution and storage.


```ts
import { Kernl, Agent } from "kernl";
import { postgres } from "@kernl-sdk/pg";
import { openai } from "@kernl-sdk/ai/openai";

const kernl = new Kernl({
  storage: {
    db: postgres({ url: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
  }
});

const jarvis = new Agent({
  id: "jarvis",
  name: "Jarvis",
  model: openai("gpt-5.2"),
  instructions: "Help Tony Stark save the world from destruction.",
  memory: { enabled: true },
});

// thread persistence is handled for you
const result = await jarvis.run("Jarvis, remember that I prefer dark mode.", {
  threadId: "thread_123",
});
```

## Philosophy

- **The future is async**: Task horizons are increasing. This will change how we build.
- **Memory is not optional**: Memory is the bottleneck to personalization and utility. It shouldn't be hard.
- **Provider agnostic**: No vendor lock-in. Swap models per-agent or per-request.
- **Open by default**: Standardization brings interoperability. The ecosystem is fragmented — we're building for a world where things work together.
- **Opinionated, but not constricting**: Strong defaults, clear patterns. But you can always do what you need to do.
