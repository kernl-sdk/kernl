# Getting Started

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @kernl-sdk/cli
```

### Create a project

```bash
kernl init my-project
cd my-project
```

### Your first agent

Open `src/agents/jarvis.ts`. This is your agent:

```ts
import { Agent } from "kernl";
import { anthropic } from "@kernl-sdk/ai/anthropic";

import { math } from "@/toolkits/math";

export const jarvis = new Agent({
  id: "jarvis",
  name: "Jarvis",
  instructions: "You are Jarvis, a helpful assistant.",
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  toolkits: [math],
});
```

The starter project includes a simple `math` toolkit—now let's add something more useful.

### Add toolkits

Toolkits give your agent capabilities. You can grab pre-built ones from the registry or write your own.

**From the marketplace**

Browse [kernl.sh/marketplace](https://www.kernl.sh/marketplace) and add with a single command:

```bash
kernl add toolkit github
```

This downloads the toolkit to `toolkits/`, installs dependencies, and shows any environment variables to configure.

**Your own tools**

Create a tool with `tool()` and group them into a `Toolkit`:

```ts
import { tool, Toolkit } from "kernl";
import { z } from "zod";

const greet = tool({
  id: "greet",
  description: "Greet someone by name",
  parameters: z.object({ name: z.string() }),
  execute: async (ctx, { name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`,
});

export const hello = new Toolkit({
  id: "hello",
  description: "Greeting tools",
  tools: [greet],
});
```

Then wire toolkits into your agent:

```ts
import { github } from "@/toolkits/github";
import { hello } from "@/toolkits/hello";

export const jarvis = new Agent({
  id: "jarvis",
  name: "Jarvis",
  instructions: "You are Jarvis, a helpful assistant.",
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  toolkits: [github, hello],
});
```

### Run your agent

There are two ways to run an agent:

**Blocking** — wait for the full response:

```ts
const result = await jarvis.run("What can you help me with?");
console.log(result.response);
```

**Streaming** — receive events as they happen:

```ts
const stream = jarvis.stream("Tell me a joke");

for await (const event of stream) {
  if (event.kind === "text.delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.text);
  }
}
```

The starter template runs this in `src/index.ts`. Try it:

```bash
pnpm start
```

</Steps>

## Project structure

The CLI scaffolds a sensible basic project structure for you:

```
src/
├── agents/
│   └── jarvis.ts
├── toolkits/
│   ├── math/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── add.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── github/        ← added via registry
│       └── index.ts
└── index.ts
```

For real applications, you'll likely want to run your agent inside a server. Check out the [microprojects](https://github.com/kernl-sdk/kernl/tree/master/microprojects) for production-ready examples:

- **Jarvis** — Chief of Staff for dev teams with Linear + GitHub toolkits
- **Watson** — Customer discovery agent with memory and workflows

Both follow the same pattern: a `server/` running Hono + kernl, and a `web/` frontend chatbot that hits the agent API.
