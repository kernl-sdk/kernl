# Marketplace

Pre-built toolkits for common integrations — GitHub, Linear, Slack, and more. Browse available toolkits at [kernl.sh/marketplace](https://www.kernl.sh/marketplace).

When you add a toolkit, the source code is copied directly into your project — just like [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com), so you have a familiar experience that we all love. You can read, modify, and extend the code however you like. No package dependency, just files in your `toolkits/` directory that you fully control.

## Adding toolkits

```bash
kernl add toolkit github
```

This will:

- Download the toolkit source to your `toolkits/` directory
- Install any required dependencies
- Show environment variables you need to configure

Add multiple at once:

```bash
kernl add toolkit github linear
```

## Using toolkits

After adding, import and use like any other toolkit:

```ts
import { github } from "@/toolkits/github";
import { linear } from "@/toolkits/linear";

const agent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-5"),
  toolkits: [github, linear],
});
```
